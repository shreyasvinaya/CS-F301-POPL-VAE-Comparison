## Problem statement
Implementing Variational Autoencoders Generative Modelling using Pyro vs Pytorch

- **Aim**: is to show improvement in reliability and ease of use for the developer to generate images.
- **Reliability**: Reduces the possibility of data type mismatches because we are using inference algorithms.
- **Ease of use**: Only the model and the guide specification are needed to run the optimizer (the objective function does not need to be specified as in the PyTorch implementation).
