Implementing Variational Autoencoders Generative Modelling using Pyro vs Pytorch

- **Aim**: is to show improvement in reliability and ease of use for the developer for generation of images.
- **Reliability**: Reduces possibility of data type mismatches because we are using inference algorithms.
- **Ease of use**: Only the model and the guide specification is needed to run the optimizer (the objective function does not need to be specified as in the PyTorch implementation).
